This repository contains the materials for the Peer-Graded Assignment of the IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project offered by IBM on Coursera. In this assignment, I have created visualizations and dashboards using IBM Cognos Analytics, utilizing datasets from the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. The primary objective is to develop three distinct dashboards: Current Technology Usage, Future Technology Trend, and Demographics. Each dashboard is designed to provide insightful visualizations through various chart types, including bar charts, word clouds, maps, and more.
